# README CONVERGENCE

This file is about the content of the `Convergence/` folder, where the 
convergence of the a priori error on rectangular/cubic meshes, respectively 
in 2D and in 3D, is done. To do this numerical error analysis, some particular 
Laplace equation with homogeneous boundary conditions are solved on domains 
(0,1)^d, where d=2 in 2D or d=3 in 3D. 

This folder contains three main subfolders, `Mesh2D`, `Mesh3D` and `Output`, 
together with a Matlab script `cvPlot` and some result plots.

## `Mesh2D/`
This folder contains the files generated by the scripts in the `Python/` folder 
that contain the information on the 2D meshes used to perform the convergence analysis.

## `Mesh3D/`
This folder contains the files generated by the scripts in the `Python/` folder 
that contain the information on the 3D meshes used to perform the convergence analysis.

## `Output/`
This folder contains the output files of `./vem`, containing the solutions 
and the error files.

## `cvPlot.m`
This scipt is used to plot the graphs `convergencePlot2D` and `convergencePlot3D` 
where the absolute a priori H^1 error is plotted with respect to the mesh size h. 
Moreover, in the script is computed algebraically the convergence order 
of the error under h-refinement.
